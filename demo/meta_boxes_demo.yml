# The way you enter Meta-boxes in Pollux is almost identical to the meta-box arrays you create with
# the Meta Box plugin. Please see "meta_box_plugin_getting_started_demo.yml" for a more comprehensive
# example of the various meta-box field types.
#
# Here are the few changes you must be aware of:
#
# 1. In the Meta Box plugin you enter an "ID" key inside the meta-box arrays and in each meta-box
#    field array. In Pollux, you enter the "ID" as the array key for each meta-box and meta-box field.
#
# 2. Unlike the Meta Box plugin, all meta-boxes must have a unique ID, and all meta-box fields
#    within a meta-box must also have a unique ID.
#
# 3. Please see "meta_box_conditions.yml" for information on how to use the "condition" and "depends" keys
#
# Copy and paste the following into the "Post Type Meta Boxes" field:
#
# This key ("front_page") is the meta-box ID
front_page:
  # This key defines which post types to attach this meta-box to.
  # Value can either be a single post type, or a list of post types.
  post_types: page
  # This key is the Meta Box title
  title: __('Front Page Options', 'pollux')
  # This key defined one or more Meta Box conditions (see "meta_box_conditions.yml" for more information)
  condition:
    is_front_page: true
  # This key defined the meta-box fields
  fields:
    # This key is the meta-box field ID
    media:
      # This key is the meta-box field type
      type: image_advanced
#
# Please see "meta_box_plugin_getting_started_demo.yml" for more information about available options
# for both meta-boxes and meta-box fields.
