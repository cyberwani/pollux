# This field contains the column labels that are shown in the Post Type admin page table.

# Built-in columns include:
# - author
# - categories
# - comments
# - date
# - media
# - slug
# - thumbnail
# - title

# The "slug" column displays the slug of the post_type
# The "media" column displays a count of images uploaded in a meta-box with an ID of "media"
# The "thumbnail" column display a thumbnail of the featured image if set.
# All other built-in columns should be self-explanatory.

# To add your own custom column:

# 1. First you must add the column to the post_type "columns" key (see post_types_demo.yml). For example:

# columns:
#  - title
#  - my_awesome_column
#  - date

# 2. Next you must add the custom column label in the "Post Type Columns" field:

my_awesome_column: __('Awesome!', 'pollux')

# 3. Finally, you must add a custom filter in your Theme's functions.php file to populate the custom column with a value:

# add_filter( 'pollux/post_type/column/my_custom_column", function() {
#     return 'Awesome!';
# });
