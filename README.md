Pollux is a theme-agnostic scaffolding plugin for WordPress which allows you to easily add custom Post Types, Taxonomies, Meta Boxes, Global Settings, and more. All that is required is a simple (YML) config file.

Pollux is intended to complement themes built on the [Castor framework](https://github.com/geminilabs/castor-framework) (i.e. [Castor](https://github.com/geminilabs/castor)), but it is not a requirement.

Minimum plugin requirements:

* PHP 5.6
* WordPress 4.7.0
